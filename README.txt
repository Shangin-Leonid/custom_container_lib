Implementing of custom C++ "like STL" containers with huge unit-testing system.


# Technologies: C++17, g++, make, git, valgrind, unit-testing

# File structure:
    + code of containers:  ./containers/
    + documentation:       ./docs/
    + unit-tests:          ./unit-tests/

# Containers:
    + array
    + circular_list

# Standarts:
Containers' behavior is closed to C++ STL.  All of objects can be used with STL algorithms. More information
about interface or realization you can find in documentation: ./docs/

# (Dis)Advantages:

    - now there is no container ;
    - no supporting allocators ;

    + additional non-standart containers;
    + simple code (for beginers) ;
    + compatible with STL algorithms and other standart libraries ;
    + custom exceptions ;
    + quick compiling and quick runtime using ;
    + huge system of unit-tests ;
