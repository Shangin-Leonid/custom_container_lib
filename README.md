# :green_book: custom_container_lib
Header-only lib with implementation of custom C++ "like STL" containers with huge unit-testing system.

#

## Technologies: C++11, g++, make, git, valgrind, unit-testing

### :open_file_folder: File structure:
+ code of containers:   [*` ./containers/ `*](https://github.com/Shangin-Leonid/custom_container_lib/containers)
+ documentation:        [*` ./docs/ `*](https://github.com/Shangin-Leonid/custom_container_lib/docs)
+ unit-tests:           [*` ./unit-tests `*](https://github.com/Shangin-Leonid/custom_container_lib/unit-tests)

#

### :package: Containers:
+ [**` circular_list `**](https://github.com/Shangin-Leonid/custom_container_lib/container/circular_list.hpp)


#

### :shield: Standarts
Containers' behavior is closed to C++ STL.  All of objects can be used with STL algorithms. More information \
about interface or realization you can find in documentation: [*` ./docs `*](https://github.com/Shangin-Leonid/custom_container_lib/docs) .

#

### :clipboard: (Dis)Advantages:

#### <ul> :x: </ul>
+ now there is no container ;
+ no supporting allocators ;


#### <ul> :heavy_check_mark: </ul>
+ additional non-standart containers;
+ simple code (for beginers) ;
+ compatible with STL algorithms and other standart libraries ;
+ custom exceptions ;
+ quick compiling and quick runtime using ;
+ huge system of unit-tests ;
